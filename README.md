# AI-Powered Crop Yield Prediction and Optimization

Developing an AI-based platform to predict crop yields using historical agricultural data, weather patterns, and soil health metrics. The system provides actionable recommendations for farmers to optimize irrigation, fertilization, and pest control, tailored to specific crops and regional conditions.

## Overview

This project was developed as part of Smart India Hackathon 2025. It uses machine learning to help farmers make informed decisions, improve yield, and optimize resource usage.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (running on `localhost:5000`)
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (running on `localhost:8080`)
- **ML Model API:** FastAPI (integrated with backend)
- **Database:** MySQL (port `3306`)
- **UI/UX Design:** Figma

---

## System Architecture

```
Frontend (React) <--> Backend (Spring Boot) <--> ML Model (FastAPI)
                                   |
                              MySQL Database
```

- The frontend communicates with the backend via REST APIs.
- The backend is responsible for business logic, API endpoints, and connecting to the ML model (exposed via FastAPI).
- MySQL is used for persistent storage.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js & npm
- Java & Maven (for Spring Boot)
- Python 3.x (for FastAPI ML Model)
- MySQL

### Local Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pranaypanakanti/Al-Powered-Crop-Yield-Prediction-and-Optimization.git
cd Al-Powered-Crop-Yield-Prediction-and-Optimization
```

#### 2. Setup MySQL Database
- Ensure MySQL is running on port 3306.
- Create the necessary schema and update credentials in the Spring Boot configuration.

#### 3. Start the Backend (Spring Boot)
```bash
cd backend
# Configure database settings in application.properties
mvn spring-boot:run
# The backend will run on http://localhost:8080
```

#### 4. Start the ML Model API (FastAPI)
```bash
cd ml-model
# (Set up your Python environment and install dependencies)
python -m uvicorn api:app --reload
```

#### 5. Start the Frontend (React)
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# The frontend will run on http://localhost:5000
```
